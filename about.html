                    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-4">Our Mission</h2>
                    <p class="mb-6">
                        We believe that Artificial Intelligence is poised to become one of the most transformative technologies humanity has ever built, 
                        and this reason alone would be enough for the Jewish community to have a stake in shaping its future. 
                        We are also driven by the conviction that the ancient wisdom of Judaism has something unique to contribute to 
                        the broader discourse on AI and society, but that until very recently, many of the prominent voices on AI and 
                        Judaism have been talking past each other, without seriously engaging with the foundational texts and ideas 
                        that our tradition has to offer.
                    </p>
                    <p class="mb-6">
                        Our goal is to gather resources that can help bridge this gap: key Jewish texts used in discussions of the 
                        questions raised by AI, articles and thinking from the 20th century that can help lay the groundwork for today's 
                        conversations, and a curated selection of more recent work exploring the implications of current and future implications 
                        for Jewish thought and practice. We also highlight AI tools and platforms that are already shaping how people interact 
                        with Jewish texts and participate in Jewish communal life.

                    <p class="mb-6">
                        This resource library contains two separate tools, each with its own goal:

                    <p class="mb-6">
                        We believe that Artificial Intelligence is poised to become one of the most transformative technologies humanity has ever built, 
                        and this reason alone would be enough for the Jewish community to have a stake in shaping its future. 
                        We are also driven by the conviction that the ancient wisdom of Judaism has something unique to contribute to 
                        the broader discourse on AI and society, but that until very recently, many of the prominent voices on AI and 
                        Judaism have been talking past each other, without seriously engaging with the foundational texts and ideas 
                        that our tradition has to offer.
                    </p>
                    <p class="mb-6">
                        Our goal is to gather resources that can help bridge this gap: key Jewish texts used in discussions of the 
                        questions raised by AI, articles and thinking from the 20th century that can help lay the groundwork for today's 
                        conversations, and a curated selection of more recent work exploring the implications of current and future implications 
                        for Jewish thought and practice. We also highlight AI tools and platforms that are already shaping how people interact 
                        with Jewish texts and participate in Jewish communal life.
                    </p>

                    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-4">What We Do</h2>
                    <p class="mb-6">
                        The relationship between AI and Judaism is bi-directional: (1) how can Jewish sources shape our thinking about AI? (2) how can AI shape our engagement with Judaism, especially Jewish texts?
                        To help move forward in both of those directions, this website has three primary components, each with slightly different goals and audiences:
                    <ul class="list-disc pl-5 mb-6 space-y-2">
                        <li>One is an 
                            <a href="AI and Judaism.html" class="text-blue-600 font-bold border-b-2 border-blue-600 pb-0.5">Internet Resource Index </a>
                            , which is an interactive list comprising of a wide range of materials pertaining to Judaism and Aritifical Intelligence. 
                            These may provide information about how Jews think about AI, about what a Jewish AI Ethic might look like, how AI might impact Jewish law and thought, etc.  
                        </li>

                        <li>Another is a set of approximately twenty
                            <a href="bibliography.html" class="text-blue-600 font-bold border-b-2 border-blue-600 pb-0.5">Research Guides </a>, which are something in between encyclopedia entries and 
                            annotated bibliographies, which are intended to help ground further scholarship and research. 
                            This is primarily geared towards scholars who may be looking to develop the "AI and Judaism" theoretical space, 
                            as well as rabbis, educators and leaders trying to guide people towards a Jewish-informed healthy engagement with AI. 
                            In addition to the "Overviews," this guide includes a collected <a href="primary-sources.html" class="text-blue-600 font-bold border-b-2 border-blue-600 pb-0.5">Source Index</a> 
                            of both primary and secondary sources that can be applied to discussions of AI and Judaism.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Finally, a third resource of <a href="tools.html" class="text-blue-600 font-bold border-b-2 border-blue-600 pb-0.5">AI Tools</a> evaluations, is strictly dedicated to how AI is shaping engagement with Jewish learning, specifically the study of Torah. 
                            We hope to survey the major AI Tools build for Torah study and engagement, and eventually move towards some objective evaluations of their respective capabilities, reliabily, and pitfalls. 
                            We would like as many voices as possible to be involved in this; please get in touch if you are interested in helping.
